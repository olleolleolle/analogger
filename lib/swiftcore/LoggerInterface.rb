			#
			# == Description
			#
			# LoggerInterface provides a module which may be used to extend an Analogger
			# Client interface, and provide a dual-mode interface, supporting both the 
			# analogger client api, and the logger api.
			#
			# === Description From logger.rb:
			# The Logger class provides a simple but sophisticated logging utility that
			# anyone can use because it's included in the Ruby 1.8.x standard library.
			#
			# The HOWTOs below give a code-based overview of Logger's usage, but the basic
			# concept is as follows.  You create a Logger object (output to a file or
			# elsewhere), and use it to log messages.  The messages will have varying
			# levels (+info+, +error+, etc), reflecting their varying importance.  The
			# levels, and their meanings, are:
			#
			# +FATAL+:: an unhandleable error that results in a program crash
			# +ERROR+:: a handleable error condition
			# +WARN+::  a warning
			# +INFO+::  generic (useful) information about system operation
			# +DEBUG+:: low-level information for developers
			#
			# So each message has a level, and the Logger itself has a level, which acts
			# as a filter, so you can control the amount of information emitted from the
			# logger without having to remove actual messages.
			#
			# For instance, in a production system, you may have your logger(s) set to
			# +INFO+ (or +WARN+ if you don't want the log files growing large with
			# repetitive information).  When you are developing it, though, you probably
			# want to know about the program's internal state, and would set them to
			# +DEBUG+.
			#
			# === Example
			#
			# A simple example demonstrates the above explanation:
			#
			#   log = Swiftcore::Analogger::Client.new('logger_interface','127.0.0.1','47990')
			#   log.extend(Swiftcore::Analogger::Client::LoggerInterface) 
			#   log.level = Logger::WARN
			#
			#   log.debug("Created logger")
			#   log.info("Program started")
			#   log.warn("Nothing to do!")
			#
			#   begin
			#     File.each_line(path) do |line|
			#       unless line =~ /^(\w+) = (.*)$/
			#         log.error("Line in wrong format: #{line}")
			#       end
			#     end
			#   rescue => err
			#     log.fatal("Caught exception; exiting")
			#     log.fatal(err)
			#   end
			#
			# Because the Logger's level is set to +WARN+, only the warning, error, and
			# fatal messages are recorded.  The debug and info messages are silently
			# discarded.
			#
			# === How to log a message
			#
			# Notice the different methods (+fatal+, +error+, +info+) being used to log
			# messages of various levels.  Other methods in this family are +warn+ and
			# +debug+.  +add+ is used below to log a message of an arbitrary (perhaps
			# dynamic) level.
			#
			# 1. Message in block.
			#
			#      logger.fatal { "Argument 'foo' not given." }
			#
			# 2. Message as a string.
			#
			#      logger.error "Argument #{ @foo } mismatch."
			#
			# 3. With progname.
			#
			#      logger.info('initialize') { "Initializing..." }
			#
			# 4. With severity.
			#
			#      logger.add(Logger::FATAL) { 'Fatal error!' }
			#
			# === Setting severity threshold
			#
			# 1. Original interface.
			#
			#      logger.sev_threshold = Logger::WARN
			#
			# 2. Log4r (somewhat) compatible interface.
			#
			#      logger.level = Logger::INFO
			#
			#      DEBUG < INFO < WARN < ERROR < FATAL < UNKNOWN
			#
			#
